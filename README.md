# SAM - Simplified Augmented Markdown 

## Why?
This is the most important question to answer. Why do we need another another simplified markup language. The reason was due to interoperabiltiy of different systems. I started working with HTML and TeX but never found a way to convert text from one format to the other. 

About 10 years ago I started writing a javascript implementation of TeX. After implementing a fixed subset for typesetting, it got complicated. In the same time I started to write a TeX system for education (based on plainTeX) because I was not satisfied with the output of Word, etc.. This made development of the javascript implementation more complicated and more ande more I had to handle style output to CSS. The way TeX and CSS handle style are different, especially due to the fact TeX is a complete programming language.

Next Idea was to write a output driver for pdfTeX/TeX which is like shoting with cannons on pigeons (German saying). The most converters like tex2html use a direct translation system. This will cause problems, if you use non default (what ever this means) commands in TeX. 

Troff is another story ...

So what I will try to do is to build a simple but powerfull and dynamic markdown language, using traditional techniques. 
* BNF Grammar (for yacc-like) for easy implementation in other languages
* clear syntax for plain text to read and to parse
* UTF-8 and URIs
* flow or stream based behavior on data includes 
* support for tex math
* JSON data support
* output to html and tex (ps, pdf, ...)
* should produce acceptable Markdown output (like this file)
* output presentations

## Elements
The plain text and readability will be improved by using mark down syntax:
*Examples are taken from [GitHub: Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)*

### Header
```
# This is an <h1> tag
## This is an <h2> tag
###### This is an <h6> tag

```

### Emphasis
```
*This text will be italic*

**This text will be bold**
```

### Lists

#### Unordered
```
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
```

#### Ordered
```
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b
```

### Blockquotes
```
> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

```

### Code
```
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
```

or blocks embedded in ` ``` ` elements.

### Syntax highlighting

> Q: Is there syntax highlighting?  
> A: No. The creator (and) main users of Acme find syntax highlighting unhelpful and distracting.

### Tables
Will be added soon (similar to GFM)

### Comments
Comments will be enabled by `%` like TeX or Erlang

### Escape Char
A escape char is needed to express differen sentences: `\`.


### Math
I think a TeX/LaTeX like syntax works best, so MathJax will be used with HTML output:
```
The Gamma function is defined as ${\displaystyle \Gamma (z)=\int _{0}^{\infty }x^{z-1}e^{-x}\,dx}$.
```
or block systax: 
```
Schr√∂dinger's equation:
$$\psi ({\mathbf  {r}},t)=A\;\exp \left(-{\frac  {{\mathrm  {i}}}{\hbar }}\;(Et-{\mathbf  {p}}\cdot {\mathbf  {r}})\right)$$
```

### Dynamics
